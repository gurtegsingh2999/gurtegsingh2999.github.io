## Latest Update :- 31st of July, 2020.
### Personal Website:
I recently finished developing this website. Truth be told, there are a lot of changes and features that I would like to implement. Nonetheless, I beleive that the website is presentable for now. 

### Undegraduate Degree:
I am currently pursuing a B.S. degree in Biomedical Engineering at UC Davis. Towards the end of my freshman year I developed a keen interest in programing and decided to add on a computer science minor as well. I am excited about the hybrid senior year that lies ahead of me and am looking forward to graduating come June 2021.

### Work:
__Plant AI and Biophysics Lab__  
I work part time as a Software Developer and Researcher for the PAIBPL under the guidance of [Dr. Mason Earles](https://bae.ucdavis.edu/people/mason-earles){:target="_blank"}. I am currently working on developing a pytorch based Mask-RCNN which trains entirely on synthetic data and generalizes well to the real world.

__Pyxeda.ai__  
I work as a part time software developer for Pyxeda.ai. My work revolves around building machine leanring and deep learning pipelines in GCP and AWS. 

__Computational RNA Genomics Lab__  
I volunteer as an Undergraduate Computational Biology Researcher under the guidance of [Dr. Sharon Aviran](https://bme.ucdavis.edu/people/sharon-aviran){:target="_blank"} and [Pierce Radecki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierce-radecki/){:target="_blank"}. I am currently finishing a research paper on the use of binary classifiers for modifying necleotide scoring. 

### Future Plans:  
__Ph.D.__  
I aim to pursue a Ph.D. in a quantitative field of study. I am currently considering Data Science, NLP and/or Computer Vision focused programs for higher education post-undergraduate.
