### Graduate School:  
**<span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> UCLA Master's of Applied Statistics Program </span>**  
I am currently a first year Graduate student at UCLA's statistics department. The [Applied Statistics](https://master.stat.ucla.edu/program/) program offers a nice blend of theoretical statistical methods along with modern day programing tools to put these methods into practice. 

I recently finished winter quarter at UCLA and suffice to say the coursework was very demanding. 

**STATS 403** focused on theoretical statistical concepts such as Random variables and common distributions, Moment generating functions, Properties of estimators (bias, efficiency, consistency), Methods of estimation (maximum likelihood, method of moments, least squares), Order statistics, Sufficient statistics, Factorization theorem, Minimal sufficiency and MVUE, Lehmann and Scheffe theorem, Rao-Blackwell theorem, Hypothesis testing, Neyman-Pearson lemma and Bonferroni multiple comparisons.

**STATS 404** involved MLE estimations, Newton-Raphson optimization and other common statistical computations using R, Python and C. 

Listed below are my completed courses so far along with scheduled courses for Spring 2022. 


**Fall 2021**

### Personal Life:
<!-- **<span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> SoCal Fever.. </span>**    -->
I have now settled into life in Santa Monica and explored a good chunk of Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley. One of my favorite pass times has been catching a show at The Comedy Store on Sunset Blvd. 


Over the next two weeks I will begin taking surfing lessons along venice beach. I have always wanted to surf and figured this would be a great opportunity to learn the craft. My goal is to be proficient come the summer so that I can make the most of the great surfing conditions SoCal has to offer! üèÑ


Lastly, I recently visited Zion National Park and had an amazing time taking in all the nature. I will be shortly posting a blog about my trip and all the amazing experiences I had. Stay tuned...

<!-- ### Personal Website:
I recently finished updating website to prep for college and job applications. I hope that the information present is sufficient for my audience to sucesfully evaluate me. If not please feel free to reach out to me for more information or any advice in general using my [contact page](/contact).

### Undegraduate Degree:
I am now in the last quarter and a half of my Bachelor's Degree in Biomedical Engineering at UC Davis with a scheduled graduation of June 2021. At the end of Summer 2020 I finished my minor in computer science. The minor took two quarters longer than expected. However, I attribute this to the extra lower divison computer science classes I registered for in an attempt to strengthen my basic understandings of algorithms and data structures. 

### Work:
__Plant AI and Biophysics Lab__  
I work part time as a Software Developer and Researcher for the PAIBPL under the guidance of [Dr. Mason Earles](https://bae.ucdavis.edu/people/mason-earles){:target="_blank"}. I am currently working on developing a pytorch based Mask-RCNN which trains entirely on synthetic data and generalizes well to the real world.

__Pyxeda.ai__  
I work as a part time software developer for [Pyxeda.ai](https://aiclub.world/about). My work revolves around building machine learning and deep learning pipelines in GCP and AWS.

__Computational RNA Genomics Lab__  
I volunteer as an Undergraduate Computational Biology Researcher under the guidance of [Dr. Sharon Aviran](https://bme.ucdavis.edu/people/sharon-aviran){:target="_blank"} and [Pierce Radecki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierce-radecki/){:target="_blank"}. My current work involves aiding the software development of [patteRNA](https://github.com/AviranLab/patteRNA){:target="_blank"}, an unsupervised pattern recognition algorithm that rapidly mines RNA structure motifs from structure profiling data. We are scheduled to publish a research paper later this year with the following working title. 

Pierce Radecki, Kaustubh Deshpande, Rahul Uppuluri, Sharon Aviran. Improved Unsupervised Detection of Structural Motifs in SHAPE Data. 2021 (in preparation)

### Future Plans:  
__M.S. and PhD__  
I am currently in the process of applying to masters programs for Data Science, AI/ML and computer science with an intended start date of 2021.
