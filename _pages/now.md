## As of December 4th 2023

### Graduate School:  
**<span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> UCLA Master's of Applied Statistics Program </span>**  
After an amazing two years in UCLA's statistics department, I graduated with a Master's degree in [Applied Statistics](https://master.stat.ucla.edu/program/), achieving a 4.0 GPA and completing a thesis on multimodal domain adaptation.

I am keen on returning as PhD student and currently in the midst of the application cycle!

### Professional Life: 

**<span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> Tixr </span>** 

Since May 2023, I have been employed as an Applied Scientist at a startup named Tixr. My experience here has been exhilarating, fueled by an exciting work culture that encourages innovation and collaboration. The proximity to the beach, Hollywood and LA in general has made it all the more enjoyable!

My current research delves into statistically identifying hallucinations in AI-generated outputs, addressing their origin, adversarial invocations, and methods for human-aligned and robust model outputs. Projects include customer report generation, client-facing chatbots, and generative AI marketing assistants, with a major focus on privacy, particularly concerning sensitive information shared with large language models (LLMs) for generation, encompassing financial and other domains.


**<span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> Amazon </span>** 

Despite a successful and educational internship experience at Amazon Devices in the summer of 2022, my return offer was rescinded amid layoffs. As a keen admirer of Amazon's work culture, I aspire to revisit the company in the future, contributing as an applied scientist tackling vision and language challenges.

### Personal Life:
<!-- **<span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> SoCal Fever.. </span>**    -->
A huge fan of the great outdoors, I had my heart set on a move to Seattle to join Amazon post graduation. However recent personal experiences have made me further realize my goal of pursuing a PhD. On that note I am happy to continue in Santa Monica as I make my way through PhD applications and continue growing as a scientist at Tixr!

Recently I've been very interested in outdoor survival camping. I draw inspiration from [The Outdoor Boys Youtube channel](<https://www.youtube.com/@OutdoorBoys>){:target="_blank"}. Really excited to attempt some winter survival camping trips over the next few months!

I was over the moon to get to visit Glacier National Park earlier this summer. Check out my [blog](/blog) page for a post coming very soon!

<!-- ### Personal Website:
I recently finished updating website to prep for college and job applications. I hope that the information present is sufficient for my audience to sucesfully evaluate me. If not please feel free to reach out to me for more information or any advice in general using my [contact page](/contact).

### Undegraduate Degree:
I am now in the last quarter and a half of my Bachelor's Degree in Biomedical Engineering at UC Davis with a scheduled graduation of June 2021. At the end of Summer 2020 I finished my minor in computer science. The minor took two quarters longer than expected. However, I attribute this to the extra lower divison computer science classes I registered for in an attempt to strengthen my basic understandings of algorithms and data structures. 

### Work:
__Plant AI and Biophysics Lab__  
I work part time as a Software Developer and Researcher for the PAIBPL under the guidance of [Dr. Mason Earles](https://bae.ucdavis.edu/people/mason-earles){:target="_blank"}. I am currently working on developing a pytorch based Mask-RCNN which trains entirely on synthetic data and generalizes well to the real world.

__Pyxeda.ai__  
I work as a part time software developer for [Pyxeda.ai](https://aiclub.world/about). My work revolves around building machine learning and deep learning pipelines in GCP and AWS.

__Computational RNA Genomics Lab__  
I volunteer as an Undergraduate Computational Biology Researcher under the guidance of [Dr. Sharon Aviran](https://bme.ucdavis.edu/people/sharon-aviran){:target="_blank"} and [Pierce Radecki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierce-radecki/){:target="_blank"}. My current work involves aiding the software development of [patteRNA](https://github.com/AviranLab/patteRNA){:target="_blank"}, an unsupervised pattern recognition algorithm that rapidly mines RNA structure motifs from structure profiling data. We are scheduled to publish a research paper later this year with the following working title. 

Pierce Radecki, Kaustubh Deshpande, Rahul Uppuluri, Sharon Aviran. Improved Unsupervised Detection of Structural Motifs in SHAPE Data. 2021 (in preparation)

### Future Plans:  
__M.S. and PhD__  
I am currently in the process of applying to masters programs for Data Science, AI/ML and computer science with an intended start date of 2021.
