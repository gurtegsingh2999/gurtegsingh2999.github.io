## Research Experience

I have previously worked at 3 research labs. My work primarily involved programing, deep learning, computer vision and statistical analysis. 

- **<span style="color:rgb(5, 58, 170)"> Plant AI & Biophysics Lab </span>**: At the PAIBL my research was centered around generating and utilizing synthetic data for computer vision tasks. Through my work I gained familiarity implementing and customizing basic computer vision architectures such as Mask R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, FCN, U-Net. I additionally worked on with various instances of object detection, semantic and instance segmentation as well as multi-model regression tasks.

- **<span style="color:rgb(5, 58, 170)"> Computational RNA Genomics Lab </span>** My research at this lab primarily involved statistical analysis of large RNA data sets and software development of the lab's primary product: PatteRNA. I worked on the experimentation and integration of a binary classifier into the PatteRNA pipeline which resulted in a rapid and accurate method for automatically detecting families of RNA structure motifs.


- **<span style="color:rgb(5, 58, 170)"> Micro-nano Innovations Lab </span>** At the MiNi lab, the aim of our project was to develop a robotic–microfluidic interface for complete pipette-free liquid handling automation. I worked on the computer vision segment of this project and the software I developed was utilized by a DOBOT robotic arm to identify chemicals in a laboratory setting and dispense them as needed.
