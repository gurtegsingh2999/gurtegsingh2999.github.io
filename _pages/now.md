## As of July 9th 2021

### Graduate School:  
**<span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> UCLA Master's of Applied Statistics Program </span>**  
I am an incoming master's student in the applied statistics program at UCLA. My registered coursework for Fall 2021 covers topics such as applied regression, methods in modern statistics, advanced regression and predictive modeling. 

My prior research experience and interests include computer vision, big data analytics, reinforcement learning as well as deep learning methodologies. On that note, I cam currently looking into various labs at UCLA where I can continue gaining research experience in these same domains. 

### Personal Life:
**<span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> Move to Los Angeles... </span>**   
It has been a challenge to secure housing in LA with a majority of apartment complexes only willing to provide virtual tours and/or photos. That being said, I am happy to have found an apartment which I will call home for the next two years. Now comes the tedious part of making back to back drives between San Jose and LA to move my stuff down there. Looking forward to being on the road!! ðŸš—

**<span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> Guitar </span>**  
After a busy end to my undergraduate career, I'm happy to be practicing the guitar during the added time at my disposal. Over the summer I'm hoping to get comfortable playing tab that involves intricate finger picking patterns as well as the thumb slap technique. 










<!-- ### Personal Website:
I recently finished updating website to prep for college and job applications. I hope that the information present is sufficient for my audience to sucesfully evaluate me. If not please feel free to reach out to me for more information or any advice in general using my [contact page](/contact).

### Undegraduate Degree:
I am now in the last quarter and a half of my Bachelor's Degree in Biomedical Engineering at UC Davis with a scheduled graduation of June 2021. At the end of Summer 2020 I finished my minor in computer science. The minor took two quarters longer than expected. However, I attribute this to the extra lower divison computer science classes I registered for in an attempt to strengthen my basic understandings of algorithms and data structures. 

### Work:
__Plant AI and Biophysics Lab__  
I work part time as a Software Developer and Researcher for the PAIBPL under the guidance of [Dr. Mason Earles](https://bae.ucdavis.edu/people/mason-earles){:target="_blank"}. I am currently working on developing a pytorch based Mask-RCNN which trains entirely on synthetic data and generalizes well to the real world.

__Pyxeda.ai__  
I work as a part time software developer for [Pyxeda.ai](https://aiclub.world/about). My work revolves around building machine learning and deep learning pipelines in GCP and AWS.

__Computational RNA Genomics Lab__  
I volunteer as an Undergraduate Computational Biology Researcher under the guidance of [Dr. Sharon Aviran](https://bme.ucdavis.edu/people/sharon-aviran){:target="_blank"} and [Pierce Radecki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierce-radecki/){:target="_blank"}. My current work involves aiding the software development of [patteRNA](https://github.com/AviranLab/patteRNA){:target="_blank"}, an unsupervised pattern recognition algorithm that rapidly mines RNA structure motifs from structure profiling data. We are scheduled to publish a research paper later this year with the following working title. 

Pierce Radecki, Kaustubh Deshpande, Rahul Uppuluri, Sharon Aviran. Improved Unsupervised Detection of Structural Motifs in SHAPE Data. 2021 (in preparation)

### Future Plans:  
__M.S. and PhD__  
I am currently in the process of applying to masters programs for Data Science, AI/ML and computer science with an intended start date of 2021.
