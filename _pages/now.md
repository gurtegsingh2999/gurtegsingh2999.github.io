## As of November 19th 2021

### Graduate School:  
**<span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> UCLA Master's of Applied Statistics Program </span>**  
I am currently a first year Graduate student at UCLA's statistics department. The [Applied Statistics](https://master.stat.ucla.edu/program/) program offers a nice blend of theoretical statistical methods along with modern day programing tools to put these methods into practice. 

I am two weeks away from wrapping up my first quarter at UCLA. My classes have been work heavy but educationally rewarding at the same time. 
Here are my schedules for Fall 2021 and Winter 2022. 

**Fall 2021**  
401 - Survey of Methods in Modern Statistics  
402 - Applied Regression  
412 - Advanced Regression and Predictive Modeling  

**Winter 2022**  
403 - Mathematical Statistics  
404 - Statistical Computing and Programming



### Personal Life:
**<span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> SoCal Fever.. </span>**   
Having lived in the bay area for a majority of my life, I was not expecting too big of a change moving down to Los Angeles. That being said, I have had an amazing couple of months here and have definitely made a home for myself in southern California. Excited to further explore this area over the coming months!!

<!-- ### Personal Website:
I recently finished updating website to prep for college and job applications. I hope that the information present is sufficient for my audience to sucesfully evaluate me. If not please feel free to reach out to me for more information or any advice in general using my [contact page](/contact).

### Undegraduate Degree:
I am now in the last quarter and a half of my Bachelor's Degree in Biomedical Engineering at UC Davis with a scheduled graduation of June 2021. At the end of Summer 2020 I finished my minor in computer science. The minor took two quarters longer than expected. However, I attribute this to the extra lower divison computer science classes I registered for in an attempt to strengthen my basic understandings of algorithms and data structures. 

### Work:
__Plant AI and Biophysics Lab__  
I work part time as a Software Developer and Researcher for the PAIBPL under the guidance of [Dr. Mason Earles](https://bae.ucdavis.edu/people/mason-earles){:target="_blank"}. I am currently working on developing a pytorch based Mask-RCNN which trains entirely on synthetic data and generalizes well to the real world.

__Pyxeda.ai__  
I work as a part time software developer for [Pyxeda.ai](https://aiclub.world/about). My work revolves around building machine learning and deep learning pipelines in GCP and AWS.

__Computational RNA Genomics Lab__  
I volunteer as an Undergraduate Computational Biology Researcher under the guidance of [Dr. Sharon Aviran](https://bme.ucdavis.edu/people/sharon-aviran){:target="_blank"} and [Pierce Radecki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierce-radecki/){:target="_blank"}. My current work involves aiding the software development of [patteRNA](https://github.com/AviranLab/patteRNA){:target="_blank"}, an unsupervised pattern recognition algorithm that rapidly mines RNA structure motifs from structure profiling data. We are scheduled to publish a research paper later this year with the following working title. 

Pierce Radecki, Kaustubh Deshpande, Rahul Uppuluri, Sharon Aviran. Improved Unsupervised Detection of Structural Motifs in SHAPE Data. 2021 (in preparation)

### Future Plans:  
__M.S. and PhD__  
I am currently in the process of applying to masters programs for Data Science, AI/ML and computer science with an intended start date of 2021.
