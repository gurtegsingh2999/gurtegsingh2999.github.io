If my life were a book, this would be my blurb.

## At A Glance

The name of my website has two interpretations: Gurteg Singh and Gurteg coaches. I have collected many “hats” over the years and this website is intended to give a glimpse into each. In layman's terms, I am a UC Davis undergraduate with a B.S in Economics, and a Georgia Tech graduate student with an M.S in Computer Science. I moved to San Francisco during the summer of 2021 to start full-time work as a Data Scientist at Verizon

In college, I was a member, and co-captain of the UC Davis Men's Soccer team. I respresented the US in the Olympics Develop Program and continue to play semi-professionally. I also worked as a business analyst for the Georgia Tech student government. My main oversight was in committee expenditure and donation cash flow (projected modelling). Additionally I also interned at Citi Bank as an data analyst. I worked in the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) department, utilizing semi-supervised models to flag suspicious transactions. Lastly, I coached soccer at the Garden State Sikh Association. During the pandemic, I coached virtually and was forced to get creative to keep the season engaging, check out how I did so [here](link-to-coaching-page).

Outside of running, I love all things outdoors - my two newest endeavors include rock climbing and mountain biking. When I need a break from using my left brain, I enjoy writing, practicing my Spanish, or re-reading my favorite books, Game of Thrones and Ender's Game. Feel free to take a look around my site. It’s an ongoing project but you can find articles about various adventures under Blog and passion projects under Portfolio. More information on my past work experiences can be found under Resume or on [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/gurtegsingh1999).
