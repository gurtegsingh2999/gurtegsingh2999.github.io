## Research Experience  

- **<span style="color:rgb(5, 58, 170)"> Tixr </span>**:   
    - Current research focuses on making LLMs more truthful by mitigating hallucinations, robust to adversarial attacks, and aligning these models with human values. The end goal is to utilize resulting models to fulfill client tasks such as financial report generation, chatbot assistance for navigating our product. 
    - Gained hands-on experience cutting open transformer architectures, implementing RLHF, RLAIF, DPO, and fine-tuning models for deployment and inference in the cloud, particularly on AWS.
    - A bigger picture research interest of mine is efficient pre training techniques and knowledge distillation. Result would be cheaper model development and smaller model size making this technology much more accessible to people around the world. 

- **<span style="color:rgb(5, 58, 170)"> Amazon </span>**:   
    - Worked with time series transformers, time series classification and regression analysis to improve existing forecast model
    - Wrote an internal research paper

- **<span style="color:rgb(5, 58, 170)"> Plant AI & Biophysics Lab </span>**:   
    - At the PAIBL my research was centered around generating and utilizing synthetic data for computer vision tasks. 
    - Working on various object detection and instance segmentation tasks, I gained familiarity implementing and customizing the Mask R-CNN architecture. 

- **<span style="color:rgb(5, 58, 170)"> Computational RNA Genomics Lab </span>** 
    - My research at this lab primarily involved statistical analysis of large RNA data sets and software development of the lab's primary product: PatteRNA. 
    - I worked on the experimentation and integration of a binary classifier into the PatteRNA pipeline which resulted in a rapid and accurate method for automatically detecting families of RNA structure motifs.


- **<span style="color:rgb(5, 58, 170)"> Micro-nano Innovations Lab </span>** 
    - At the MiNi lab, the aim of our project was to develop a robotic–microfluidic interface for complete pipette-free liquid handling automation.
    - I worked on the computer vision segment of this project and the software I developed was utilized by a DOBOT robotic arm to identify chemicals in a laboratory setting and dispense them as needed.
